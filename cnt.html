    <u><h1><font color="lightgreen">Mango juice:</font></h1></u>
    <p>
        The process begins by selecting fresh, ripe mangoes usually varieties known for their juicy texture and sweetness. The mangoes are peeled, the seed is removed, and the flesh is cut into pieces. These mango pieces are then blended with a small amount of cold water to create a smooth juice. Depending on preference, a bit of sugar, honey, or lemon juice may be added to enhance flavor. The juice is then strained to remove any fibrous bits for a smoother consistency. It can be served chilled or with ice for a cooling effect.</p>

    <u><h1><font color="red">orange juice:</font></h1></u>
    <p>
        The process typically starts with selecting high-quality, juicy oranges that are fully ripened to ensure a sweet and tangy flavor. The oranges are first washed thoroughly to remove any dirt or pesticides. They are then peeled or cut in half, depending on the method used. In home settings, a manual or electric juicer is often used to squeeze the juice out of the fruit, separating it from the pulp and seeds. For smoother juice, it may be strained through a fine sieve or cheesecloth to remove excess pulp and fiber. Some people like to add a small amount of lemon juice or a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor, though pure orange juice is often enjoyed on its own. Once extracted, the juice can be served fresh or chilled for a more refreshing drink.</p>

<u><h1><font color="blue">Freez juice</font></h1></u>
<p>
Making frozen refreshing juice involves preparing fresh juice and then freezing it to enjoy later as a cool, healthy treat. First, select ripe and fresh fruits like oranges, mangoes, or berries, and wash them thoroughly. Peel and cut the fruits if necessary, then extract the juice using a juicer or blender. For a smoother texture, strain the juice to remove any pulp or seeds. You can add a little lemon juice to enhance flavor and help preserve freshness. Next, let the juice cool in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to reduce ice crystal formation. Pour the cooled juice into freezer-safe containers or molds, leaving some space at the top for expansion. Label the containers with the date and place them in the freezer. Once frozen, the juice can be enjoyed as a chilled drink by thawing it slightly, or used to make refreshing ice pops. This process preserves the juiceâ€™s natural flavors and nutrients, making it a convenient and tasty way to stay hydrated.</p>
